                    <p> After a busy period of time I managed to make a good start on the software. The first couple of hours I spent fixing a bug in opencv as the documentation was not displaying for anything. That required a clean install of python. After
                        that however, I managed to get opencv to play a video and crop a rectangle from the centre of the original video. Valentines day well spent.</p>

                    <p> Worked on the project outline. Completed the first and second section. Was unsure of what to list on the deliverables, going to bring this up in next supervisor meeting. I have also received the data for crabs and lobsters so I will
                        need to start looking at YOLO and ways to process this.</p>

                    <p>Tried having a go at creating a configuration list as specified in SEQA8. Its definitely a draft at the moment but was good trying to figure out how documents and how the config_refs section will work. Hoping that I can improve the
                        current config ref list I made for the future. As this one is a bit too brief </p>
