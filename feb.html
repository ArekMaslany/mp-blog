                    <h2>Template for UI Spec</h2>
                    <h5>11th of February, 2021</h5>
                    <p>After our tutorial the group decided to meet in dicsord to discuss improvements to the User Interface and Test Specifications. I tried to be of help so decided to make a template for the User Interface spec that adheres to the standards
                        of SEQA2 and SEQA4. I am hoping that itll be useful and am planning on making one for Testing as well.</p>

                    <p>Tried having a go at creating a configuration list as specified in SEQA8. Its definitely a draft at the moment but was good trying to figure out how documents and how the config_refs section will work. Hoping that I can improve the
                        current config ref list I made for the future. As this one is a bit too brief </p>

                    <h5>5th of February, 2021</h5>
                    <p>We met up in discord and tried creating the group repository. We realised the QA manages and is responsible for the repository so we decided it would be best to assign roles at that point. Richard is Project Leader, Oliver is PL deputy,
                        I am QA Manager, Ignacy is QA deputy </p>

                    <h2>Group meeting & GitLab Practical</h2>
                    <h5>3rd of February, 2021</h5>
                    <p>As arranged in the tutorial the group met up and we managed to spend a few hours helping eachother working through the practical. The practical consisted of an individual section which was fairly straight forward and a section where
                        a partner was needed. Me and Maciek [mam161] worked through this together, there was 1 error but we managed to get through it regardless. I did the practical on mac but I want to try using the windows method that consists of using
                        gitBash as that seemed more challenging.</p>
