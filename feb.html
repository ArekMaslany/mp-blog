                    <p> Worked on the project outline. Completed the first and second section. 
                        Was unsure of what to list on the deliverables, going to bring this up in next supervisor meeting.
                        I have also received the data for crabs and lobsters so I will need to start looking at YOLO and ways to process this.</p>

                    <p>Tried having a go at creating a configuration list as specified in SEQA8. Its definitely a draft at the moment but was good trying to figure out how documents and how the config_refs section will work. Hoping that I can improve the
                        current config ref list I made for the future. As this one is a bit too brief </p>
