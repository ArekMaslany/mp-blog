            <h2>Welcome to my major project blog.</h2>
            <p>This blog will accompany me as I develop the project. </p>
            <p>Here you will find details on the progress being made. Along with the time spent on each part.</p>
            <p>The blog contains a section for each month. I split the project into months as it will provide some structure to separate the work.</p>
            <p>There is also a section containing the project outline. There you will find a detailed report on what the project is and how I plan on developing it.</p>
